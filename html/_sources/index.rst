.. note:: This file was build on |today|, rev. |version| / git |release| of `the source <https://github.com/edhamma/mahasi-diary>`__.

.. admonition:: Electronic edition notice

   This book was digitized from typewritten edition which I got hold of by curious ways of events. I was told that it had been translated from Burmese original published in print in the 1960's (?). If someone knows more, I will gladly complete this notice â€” please contact me.

   Sectioning hierarchy was sometimes somewhat ambiguous. In some cases ending of a comment was ambiguous. Obvious minor mistakes  (such as a word repeated twice) in typing were corrected. Archaic spelling and pali transcription were left as-is. Tags like [:12:] denote pages of the original.
